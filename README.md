# TextMate Feature Requests

The mailing list is generally a good place for constructive dialog about potential new features or tweaks to those which already exist. Though if you prefer to skip such dialog (or already had it) then you can submit suggestions using the issue tracker for this GitHub project.

When submitting a suggestion then keep in mind that the best way to get someone to implement it is to convince them of the general value of what you propose.

This can be done by describing the problem that it is supposed to solve or the workflow it improves.
